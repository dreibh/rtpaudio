Description: RTP Audio sound streaming system
 The RTP Audio system consists of a server and several clients, which are
 served with audio data from the server. The transmission is realized using
 the RTP protocol (Real-Time Protocol, see RFC 1889) based on UDP. RTP Audio
 supports IPv4 and IPv6 including flowlabels and traffic classes.
